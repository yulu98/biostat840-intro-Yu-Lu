## Backgroud

![](intro.jpg)

#### Question

How is the total cost of incidents for different species and different service types change across time?

#### Intended audience

People who are interested in the cost of incidents for animal rescue.

#### Data Origin

The origin of the data comes from [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021). Specifically, we will use the following data from June, 2021.

::: column-margin

Tidy Tuesday provides interesting date sets every Tuesday. (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)

:::

#### Data Description

Here is a data dictionary for what all the column names mean:

https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-06-29/readme.md#animal_rescuescsv

::: column-margin

Fox in bedroom, dog trapped in wall. The London Fire Brigade responds to hundreds of requests to rescue animals each year. Its monthly-updated spreadsheet of such events goes back to 2009; it lists the location and type of property, the kind of animal and rescue, hours spent, a (very) brief description, and more. [@London]

#### Data wrangling

I used tidyverse[@tidyverse], dplyr[@dplyr], lubridate[@lubridate] to wrangle the data.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate) 
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2021-06-29')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2021, week = 27)

animal_rescues <- tuesdata$animal_rescues

data <- animal_rescues %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(hour = factor(hour(dmy_hm(date_time_of_call)))) %>%
  separate(animal_group_parent, c("animal_group", "other"), "-") %>%
  filter(incident_notional_cost != "NULL") %>%
  mutate(incident_notional_cost = as.numeric(incident_notional_cost)) %>%
  select(date_time_of_call, cal_year, pump_hours_total, 
         hourly_notional_cost, incident_notional_cost,
         animal_group, special_service_type_category, hour) 
```

-   removed all NAs

-   used date operation to seperate hours of rescue from the time

-   seperated a column of strings by "-"

-   filtered out NULL incident total cost

-   select wanted columns

## Distribution of cost with Histogram

We first show the distribution of total and hourly cost of incidents with histograms.
:::

```{r}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(incident_notional_cost)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of total cost of incidents",
       subtitle = "Most of total cost of incidents gathered 200 - 300 \nbut the maximized total cost reached 3480",
       caption = "Data source: TidyTuesday") + 
  labs(x = "Total cost of incidents",
       y = "Frequency") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20),
      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),
      axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 50, hjust = 0.8),
      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))

data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(hourly_notional_cost)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of total cost of incidents",
       subtitle = "The distribution of the hourly cost of incidents spread across 250 - 300 pretty much equally",
       caption = "Data source: TidyTuesday") + 
  labs(x = "Hourly cost of incidents",
       y = "Frequency") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20),
      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),
      axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 50, hjust = 0.8),
      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))
```

## Cost over time with point plots

We then show the trend of total and hourly cost of incidents over time with scatter plots.
:::

```{r}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = cal_year, y = incident_notional_cost)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Total cost of incidents over time (2009 - 2015)",
       subtitle = "The total cost of incidents remains pretty much the same across time with a bit rise",
       caption = "Data source: TidyTuesday") + 
  labs(x = "Time (Year)",
       y = "Total cost of incidents") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20),
      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),
      axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 50, hjust = 0.8),
      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))

data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = cal_year, y = hourly_notional_cost)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Hourly cost of incidents over time (2009 - 2015)",
       subtitle = "The hourly cost of incidents has a significant rise across time, \nconsidering the stable total cost of incidents, \nanimal rescue is more efficient across time",
       caption = "Data source: TidyTuesday") + 
  labs(x = "Time (Year)",
       y = "Hourly cost of incidents") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20),
      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),
      axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 50, hjust = 0.8),
      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))
```

## Cost over different time of the day with box plots

We will show the trend of total and hourly cost of incidents over different time of the day with box plots, categorized by special service type.
:::

```{r}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = incident_notional_cost)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ special_service_type_category) +
  labs(title = "Total cost of incidents over different time of the day",
       subtitle = "The total cost of incidents is the highest in the morning for animal rescued from below groud and animal rescued from water",
       caption = "Data source: TidyTuesday") + 
  labs(x = "Time (Hour)",
       y = "Total cost of incidents") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20),
      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),
      axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 50, hjust = 0.8),
      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))

data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = hourly_notional_cost)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ special_service_type_category) +
  labs(title = "Hourly cost of incidents over different time of the day",
       subtitle = "The hourly cost of incidents remains basically the same across different time of the dat",
       caption = "Data source: TidyTuesday") + 
  labs(x = "Time (Hour)",
       y = "Hourly cost of incidents") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20),
      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),
      axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 50, hjust = 0.8),
      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))
```
